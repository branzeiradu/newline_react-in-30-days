Complex components.

Building an entire application in a single component is not a good idea because it can grow huge and complex, therefore, difficult to test.

Rather than building this into a single component, you should break it into multiple child components.

It's a good idea to look at applications from the perspective of components. By breaking the app down into components it becomes easier to test and to keep track of what functionality goes where.

When a component is nested inside another component, it's called a child component. A component can have multiple children components. Each component that has children components is called a parent component.
