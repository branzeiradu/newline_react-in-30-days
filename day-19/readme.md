Data Management with Redux

Setup up Redux inside a React application:
1. Define reducers.
2. Create a store.
3. Create action creators.
4. Link the store to our React views

We have to restructure our app so we can add a wrapper component to provide data down through our app.


    [Root] --> [App] --> [Router/Routes] --> [Component]
